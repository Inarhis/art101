            <p>The challenge of this lab was to create a function in JavaScript with DOM manipulation.</p>

        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <div>
            <p>I did not have many problems creating and doing this lab, but I did have a bit of trouble linking my CSS with my HTML code. For some reason, every time I create a new lab folder, I have to add an additional line of code in my HTML at the top to get it working.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Overall, I thought this challenge was really easy as I have struggled on the previous labs. I think it's cool to see how much you can mess with JavaScript code to create different functions.</p>
