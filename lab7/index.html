                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to implement a 
                    function that gets a users name and resorts it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> I did not have many problems but I was struggling a bit on my layout for my page. 
                    I also had a bit of trouble making my function work but I ended up fixing it with the 
                    help of online resources.

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> I thought this lab was very easy as it was pretty straightfoward and simple. I followed the
                    tutorial closely and then styled my css page to fit it with my ongoing theme. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p> Below is my function. </p>
