        <h2>Problems</h2>
        <div>
        <p>At first, my Javascript file was not linking to my html which was frustrating.
            I eventually realized I skipped a step on Task 1, so I fixed it with ease. I ran into
             another issue about my CSS not formating properly but with the help of online resources, 
             I figured it out.</p>

            <P>I would say this lab was fairly easy, considering there was only 3 tasks and a very straightfoward
                tutorial. This was a fun lab to work on.
            </P>
