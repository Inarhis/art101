                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to make a function in Javascript using jQuery. Specifically,
                    adding buttons and event listeners to this HTML file. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="problems">
                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> Some problems I had with this lab is getting my CSS file to link in my HTML file.
                    For some reason, it was not showing up on my webpage so I troubleshooted my code and 
                    solved the issue. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="reflection">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> Overall, this lab was a bit new to me since I did not know how to use jQuery but with the help 
                    of online resources and the TA, I was able to fix my problems. </p>
            </div>
