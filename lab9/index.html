            <p> Some problems I had with this lab is getting my CSS file to link in my HTML file.
                For some reason, it was not showing up on my webpage so I troubleshooted my code and 
                solved the issue. </p>

            <p> Overall, this lab was a bit new to me since I did not know how to use jQuery but with the help 
                of online resources and the TA, I was able to fix my problems. </p>
