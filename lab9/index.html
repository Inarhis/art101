                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to make a function in Javascript using jQuery. Specifically,
                    adding buttons and event listeners to this html file. </p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p> Some problems I had with this lab is getitng my CSS file to link in my html file.
                    For some reason it was not showing up on my webpage so I troubleshooted my code and 
                    solved the issue. </p>

            <div class="minor-section">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p> Overall, this lab was a bit new to me since I did not know how to use jQuery but with the help 
                    of online resources and the TA I was able to fix my problems. </p>
