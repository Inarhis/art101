            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I am Jianne, a third year AGPM major. In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends, playing video games, and completing jigsaw puzzles. Some 
            games I enjoy are Terraria, Minecraft, and Overcooked. I love to draw digitally and traditionally but have little experience with coding. I would say I am a pretty
            introverted person and enjoy being by myself most times. I am excited to become more familiar with CSS and HTML as I continue to learn in this class.</p>
