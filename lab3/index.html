                <h2>Challenge</h2>
                <p>The challenge of this lab was to reformat our own website's homepage and stylize it using CSS.
                    I had to edit the HTML files for my homepage and for my lab 3.</p>

                <h2>Problems</h2>
                <p>Some problems I had for this lab were struggling to upload my picture to my website.
                    This was because I accidentally put my HTML file in my CSS folder. So, I moved the
                    HTML file outside of the CSS folder and the image worked.</p>

                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Overall, I feel like I struggled a lot with this project because I was very confused on
                    how to format both HTMLs correctly. The TA helped me a lot with my errors and I believe
                    I did well on this assignment.</p>
